Final day of devoxx Belgium 2017. Luckily there were only three sessions that day, since it has been some much input
this far that I couldn't take much more.

## How to build an event-driven, dynamically re-configurable micro-services platform

If you call yourself architect and like the ivory tower, then you might enjoy
[Sven Beauprez](https://twitter.com/SvenBeauprez)'s presentation on the architecture of their product.
It's all bubbles and clouds (not Cloud Computing).
If you're developer, just skip this one.

## Troubleshooting & Debugging Production Microservices in Kubernetes

Watching [Ray Tsang](https://twitter.com/saturnism) from Google and [Baruch Sadogursky](https://twitter.com/jbaruch)
of JFrog was a fantastic show, even more entertaining than Josh Long & Mark Heckler the day before.
And on top of this, they showed really cool stuff, e.g. adding logs to an already deployed application, running in
production.
If you're running Kubernetes in production, or plan to do so, this is a must-see!

## Java Language Futures -- All Aboard Project Amber

In the final session of this years devoxx, [Brian Goetz](https://twitter.com/BrianGoetz) presented the stuff 
Project Amber is working on at Oracle.
Even with the clear statement that for most topics it's not yet decided when they will be added to Java, this was really
a nice outlook to the future of Java.
And there is a lot of interesting stuff to come: local type inference, case classes (which will probably be named
differently), sealed classes and pattern matching.
If you have some spare time and want to know what's on the horizon, this talk is also recommended for your playlist.

## Final summary

Wow!
Really really huge thanks to the team of the devoxx Belgium. 
It's been a fantastic experience, packed with amazing talks.
It held so much more input than I could see or soak up that I'm very happy that all talks are available on Youtube, and
quickly.
Trying to summarize it, I can only state that, in my opinion, the devoxx is THE conference to go to for Java developers.
It's community-riven, it offers very high-profile speakers, interesting topics centered around mainstream JVM languages,
while still looking beyond the fence, and offers a very nice atmosphere. 
And last but not least, it's held at a great location with Kinepolis cinema.
As a reference to this, I'm wrapping up with this quote:
